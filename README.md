# routing-assignment
React routing assignment for 2 pages and a nested page with query string in the url

The Assignment was:

<ol style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
  <li>Add Routes to load "Users" and "Courses" on different pages (by entering a URL, without Links)</li>
  <li>Add a simple navigation with two links => One leading to "Users", one leading to "Courses"</li>
  <li>Make the courses in "Courses" clickable by adding a link and load the "Course" component in the place of "Courses" (without passing any data for now)</li>
  <li>Pass the course ID to the "Course" page and output it there</li>
  <li>Pass the course title to the "Course" page - pass it as a param or score bonus points by passing it as query params (you need to manually parse them though!)</li>
  <li>Load the "Course" component as a nested component of "Courses"</li>
  <li>Add a 404 error page and render it for any unknown routes</li>
  <li>Redirect requests to /all-courses to /courses (=> Your "Courses" page)</li>
</ol>
